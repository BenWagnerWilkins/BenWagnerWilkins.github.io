              Here is the schematic and calculations. I calculated that the current going through the transistor is about .435A. I'm honestly very confused about all the calculations and transistors in general, but I hope this is right.

              Here is a picture of my circuit. I am only using 2 pins, the 2 pin for the button sensor, and the 9 pin to change the brightness of the LED strip.

            <h2>Code Snippet</h2>
            <code>
              <pre>
int button = 2; //pin for button

int LEDControl = 9; // transistor control for LED strip
int brightness = 0; // initial brightness level
// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  pinMode(button, INPUT); //button is input
  pinMode(LEDControl, OUTPUT); // LED is output
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  // read the state of the button and check if it is pressed
  if (digitalRead(button) == HIGH && brightness < 255){ //if button is press and is under maximum brightness then do the following
      analogWrite(LEDControl, brightness); // sets the LED Strip brightness
      brightness += 5; // increases brightness level
      delay(50); // 50 ms delay
   } else if (brightness > 0) { //if button is not pressed and brighness is not zero (to preven from wrapping around)
      analogWrite(LEDControl, brightness - 5); // sets brightness (subtract 5 so it turns all the way off)
      brightness -= 5; // decrease brightness level
      delay(50); // 50 ms delay
   }

  delay(1);        // delay in between reads for stability
}
              </pre>
            </code>

            <h2>Here it is in Action!</h2>
            <img src="assignment4imgs/video.gif" width=400>
            <p>
              While the button is pressed, the LED strip gets brighter. When you let go, the LED strip starts to dim.
