              Here is the schematic. It is pretty simple, since both pieces of hardware I used had the resistance and all that good stuff built in. Since I used a DC motor, I used a flyback diode.

              This is my circuit. I only connect power, ground, and VRy on the joystick to the arduino because in my design, I did not need the switch or the VRx value.

            <h2>Code Snippet</h2>
            <code>
              <pre>
int yPin = A1; // pin for reading the yValue
int yVal = 0; // the actual yValue
int motor = 9; // the pin the motor is connected to

void setup() {
  pinMode(motor, OUTPUT);  //setting motor to output
  Serial.begin(9600); //initializing seriol logging
}

void loop() {
  yVal = analogRead(yPin); // getting the value from the pin
  Serial.print("y = ");  //printing it to check the value
  Serial.println(yVal);  //printint it to check the value
  yVal = 1023 - yVal; //since all the way up is 0, and all the way down was 1023,
                      // I wanted to switch that around to make it more intuitive

  int motorVal = map(yVal, 0, 1023, 100, 255);  //had to map the motor to make it have
                                                //acceptable values

  analogWrite(motor, motorVal);  // telling the motor how fast I want it

  delay(15); // 15ms delay
}
              </pre>
            </code>

            <h2>Here it is in Action!</h2>

            <p>
              When you move the joystick up, the motor speeds up, and when you tilt it down, the motor slows down. I mapped the values from between 100 and 255 because the motor doesn't spin at all underneath the value of 100 assumingly due to the friction inside of the motor.
